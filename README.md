# Image-Captioning-Project
A Deep Learning Project - Captioning of Images and Generating Poems

This project is a comprehensive exploration of diverse deep learning architectures for natural language processing and creative content generation. We employed a hybrid CNN+LSTM model alongside a transformer-based model, conducting an in-depth comparative analysis to discern their respective strengths and weaknesses in capturing intricate patterns within textual data. Simultaneously, we harnessed the power of the GPT-2 and FastAI libraries to generate evocative poems from image captions.
